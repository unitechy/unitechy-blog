The present fort is ascribed to Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan which incidentally is his birthplace. It has an east oriented fortification. The bastions are provided with gun points built in brick and lime.

- [ ] Tipu's Summer residence

- [ ] Brahmashram - Another spot for the solitude seekers, Brahmashram is essentially a cave. The Sage Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used the cave as an ashram for his meditation. Owing to this, Brahmashram has become one of the more popular religious sites in the region. The natural structure and earthy feel make this a perfect spot for some worship and tranquility all balanced out.

- [ ] Yoga Nandeeshwar Temple - Quite beautiful temple
