Would recommend you to travel via main road through Leela Palace road. Everything else is dug up in and around Indiranagar. 

My house has marble flooring, if you feel cold easily, please carry socks. 

It's BYOB so plan accordingly. 

There's no car parking in the building. You'll have to park outside.
