##### Blog
Made Coffee Saccharum today following Dan Fellow's recipe. I drink at least two cups of coffee everyday. I brew either an [[Espresso]] or through [[Aeropress]] method. Although these days, I've been brewing more of [[V60]] thanks for [[Vardhman]] lending me his old one.

Since I got my new esspresso cups from [[Curiouslife]] I've got back to my daily dose of double esspresso shots. I had been planning to make Coffee Saccharum since this year Diwali. 

This recipe requires `spirit of choice` and since I had [[Old Monk]] at home gifted by a friend and since I don't drink Old Monk, I've used it.

##### Notes from the Dan: 
if you are using this technique for Espresso Martinis, make sure you use equal parts pucks, sugar and filter coffee for best results! For me, this is the most versatile, delicious and easy way to add coffee to cocktails, not to mention being very cheap and using otherwise wasted ingredients! ♻️ 
COFFEE SACCHARUM RECIPE - 200g Fresh espresso pucks (you can ask your local coffee shop for these if you don't brew espresso at home. Make the same day) - 200g Golden caster sugar (or your choice of sugar) - 400g Strong filter coffee or leftover batch brew - 200g Your spirit of choice 


##### Method 
Combine the espresso pucks and sugar until they make a thick, glossy paste. Add coffee and spirit, mix and paper strain. This can be bottled and stored in the fridge to be added to loads of different coffee cocktails.

##### Ingredients
- 1 part esspresso puck
- 1 part sugar
- 1 part rum
- 2 part filter coffee
